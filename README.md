Hi!, 

I live and work in Sweden, but I'm originally from Honduras. I recently switched to Neovim as my main code editor, so when I'm not working, I'll probably spend time tuning Neovim setup or reviewing some news on Reddit about it. Because of that, I started to learn Golang; I will see how that goes.
